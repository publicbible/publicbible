[{"v":"101001001","c":"The author of the SAB claims there are two creation accounts in Genesis. This is a 19th century invention. And because there are no 2 creation accounts, there is no contradiction. I.e. the premise is false, therefore the conclusion doesn't follow. For a more in-depth discussion see <a href=\"http:\/\/creation.com\/genesis-contradictions\">Genesis contradictions<\/a>. &bull; For those interested in the history of the book Genesis, it appears that Genesis is far older than originally assumed by the church. It seems quite likely that Moses did not write Genesis, but compiled it from very ancient sources, clay tablets taken from Ur by Abraham or perhaps given to Abraham by Sem, son of Noah. The ancient form and composition of these clay tablets is still visible in our Bible, but the knowledge of its particular features was lost. It was only understood again after archaeologists had dug up the tens of thousands of clay tablets we now have. See for a brief introduction <a href=\"http:\/\/creation.com\/who-wrote-genesis-are-the-toledoth-colophons\">Who Wrote Genesis? Are the Toledoth Colophons?<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblearchaeology.org\/post\/2010\/10\/11\/The-Tablet-Theory-of-Genesis-Authorship.aspx\">The Tablet Theory of Genesis Authorship<\/a> and see also P.J. Wiseman's original article <a href=\"http:\/\/www.angelfire.com\/mo\/launchingpad\/index.html\">Creation Revealed In Six Days: The evidence of Scripture confirmed by Archaeology<\/a>. &bull; On who created the heaven and the earth, all three persons on the Godhead were present and active. In <a href=\"1.html#v2\">the next verse<\/a> (verse 2) for example we also see that the Spirit of God was present. &bull; On when the universe was created: I personally agree with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stephenjaygould.org\/library\/gould_house-ussher.html\">bishop Ussher<\/a>'s calculation, but it's not important to agree exactly with him. Everyone who reads the Bible without \u2018scientific\u2019 preconceptions will come to the conclusion the earth is some 6,000 years old. <a href=\"http:\/\/creation.com\/archbishops-achievement\">Isaac Newton calculated a date of about 4000 BC<\/a> for example. But note that the age of the earth is thought to be much younger than the age of the rest of the universe, see <a href=\"1.html#v31\">verse 31<\/a>. &bull; On the Gap Theory: the author of the SAB gives sufficient links that disprove this theory compellingly."},{"v":"101001002","c":"First, I agree with the author of the SAB that the order in Genesis conflicts with the stories told by those who call themselves scientists. So trying to fit Genesis into such accounts, won't work. They are clearly opposed. One of them has to yield. &bull; There is some difference between us in reading Genesis though. The creation starts in <a href=\"1.html#v3\">verse 3<\/a>, the first two verses are an introduction on what was to be created. &bull; Lastly I want to protest against the phrase \u201cevents that are known to science.\u201d Because where does truth come from? Is that from things told by scientists? In that case we have been deceived many times in the past as the facts turned out to be different. But also, were scientists present when these events unfolded? They were not. Can they repeat them in a laboratory? They can not. As even many young earth creationists believe that the rest of the universe is much older, one could say that we could use that as some constraint on our hypothesis. But have we ever seen a star form? We have not. Have we ever seen planets form? We have not. Does our current solar system conform to theories that have been invented on how solar systems come to pass? It does not. Every feature of our solar system is thought to have come to pass by an act of God, or as scientists like to say: some comet hit something and that's why things are the way they are. That's not a scientific explanation. For a detailed and sometimes hilarious account on \u2018scientific explanations of the original of our universe\u2019 see <a href=\"http:\/\/creationwiki.org\/Our_Created_Solar_System\">Our Created Solar System<\/a>."},{"v":"101001003","c":"Obviously there were photons before there were stars... &bull; For those less well-versed in physics: light comes from mass-less particles called photons. Photons are emitted by the sun, and when they hit your eye (either directly or after hitting other objects first), this produces a reaction by which sight is possible. Although the sun is the biggest source of photons, it's obviously not necessary. Light bulbs produce photons as well. &bull; For those interested in physics: it's interesting to see that the first created things are water and light. The chemical formula for water is H<sub>2<\/sub>O. Meaning that it consists of two elements, H, hydrogen, and O, oxygen. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. It's the most simple one as well, consisting of two particles with mass: a proton and an electron. So at the beginning of creation we see Scripture mentioning the most basic elements. But we also see a far more complex element O: this indicates that atoms were not formed after millions of years by naturalistic processes, <a href=\"http:\/\/creation.com\/element-origins-big-bang\">but immediately by God<\/a>. &bull; The Bible never mentions these elements as we call them, as the Bible is not a shortcut to scientific knowledge. But the Bible does not contradict science, and when science contradicts the Bible, science itself will prove such science to be wrong, although we might have to wait some years for that to happen."},{"v":"101001006","c":"The Hebrew word translated with firmament is plural. See <a href=\"http:\/\/creation.com\/is-the-raqiya-firmament-a-solid-dome\">Is the raqiya\u2018 (\u2018firmament\u2019) a solid dome?<\/a>"},{"v":"101001011","c":"As per <a href=\"1.html#v3\">verse 3<\/a>, plants do not need a sun as anyone who has ever lived close to a modern green house can confirm. They only need photons. &bull; On if plants were created before or after humans, see <a href=\"2.html#v5\">chapter 2:5<\/a>. &bull; On the phrase \u201clet the earth bring forth grass\u201d, it seems the author of the SAB reads this as God giving a command to the earth to start the evolutionary process. But evolution, even if it could work, would require a bit more than a day. So the phrase simply means that God created from the elements in the earth the grass and other herbs. So God spoke, and the grass was there."},{"v":"101001014","c":"It appears the phrase \u201cfor signs\u201d is interpreted by the author of the SAB as \u201cthey can be used for fortune telling.\u201d That's not a very likely interpretation. As <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studylight.org\/com\/geb\/view.cgi?book=ge&chapter=1&verse=14\">John Gill has it<\/a>: <blockquote>for \"signs\" of good and bad weather; for the times of ploughing, sowing, reaping, &amp;c. and for the \"seasons\" of summer and winter, spring and autumn; for \"days\" by a circular motion for the space of twenty four hours; and for \"years\" by annual motion for the space of three hundred sixty five days and odd hours.<\/blockquote> And yes, the Bible condemns astrology, not astronomy, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/dt\/18.html#v10\">Deut. 18:10<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/mt\/2.html#v2\">Matthew 2:2<\/a>."},{"v":"101001016","c":"On the light of the moon: obviously the author of the SAB hasn't spend much time outside at night at full moon. That's a lot of light... But the moon was not only for giving light, also for days and years. Thanks to its phases it is possible to count months and years. &bull; On the second point, obviously from an earth-centred, human perspective, the sun and moon are somewhat more important, so that's why they are singled out in this verse. But the previous two verses talk about all stars, not just sun and moon, I.e. we use stars for signs, that is navigation, we use them for dating historical events, etc."},{"v":"101001017","c":"As said before, the stars had more functions. But the stars are also created by God for his glory, to show his glory and infinite capacity, even to human civilisations that possess a Hubble telescope."},{"v":"101001020","c":"The author of the SAB confuses two kinds of animals. This verse is about the animals that live in the water. The waters are commanded to bring forth the animals that live in the water. <a href=\"1.html#v24\">A few verses later<\/a> (verse 24) the earth is commanded to bring forth the animals that live on dry land. &bull; The verse <a href=\"2.html#v19\">chapter 2:19<\/a> is clearly about the beasts of the field, not about the fowls and creatures that live in the water as in this and subsequent verses. So <a href=\"2.html#v19\">chapter 2:19<\/a> should be compared with <a href=\"1.html#v24\">verse 24<\/a> and they are perfectly in harmony."},{"v":"101001024","c":"No. If readers follow the link the author of the SAB quotes A.D. White, an extremely unreliable witness who just makes up things as he goes.

It does not need to be said that such views find no warrant in this text or in the Bible. And how the amount of pigment a skin can make determines if one is human or not is clearly as inhuman as believing a person does not need the protection of the law while in its mother's womb."},{"v":"101001026","c":"There is one God, but there are three persons in the Godhead. Already in the first chapter of Genesis we find a clear indication of that when the one God says, let <em>us<\/em> make. &bull; The author of the SAB also claims that this verse has given justification to fundamental Christians for mistreat and disregard of the environment. Yes, only fundamental Christians mistreat the environment as only they have a justification for that. But the facts are that it are the atheistic nations that have had the greatest disrespect for nature. I think not a single example of a fundamental Christian with an actual disrespect for nature can be brought forward, while on the other hand we have indisputable proof of the communist regimes absolute mistreatment of the environment."},{"v":"101001027","c":"On the creation of Adam, the author of the SAB links to another failed prophecy of the Jehovah's witnesses. Jehovah's witnesses are not Christians and use only those portions of the Bible that suit them. This failed prophecy puts them firmly into the category of false prophets as per the Biblical test in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/dt\/18.html#v20\">Deut. 18:20-22<\/a>. &bull; On the creation of Eve, this verse only says that God created both Adam and Eve. Both were created by God. No mention of a time line. More details follow in the next chapter. &bull; On if God is both male and female: God reveals himself in the Bible mainly, but not exclusively, see for example <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/is\/66.html#v13\">Is. 66:13<\/a>, in male form. But God is neither of course, if God speaks in these categories it is for our understanding. &bull; The author of the SAB continues to say \u201cmen and women are of equal value and importance.\u201d This is true, but it does not mean there is no distinction between them. But in heaven the distinction will be removed, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/gal\/3.html#v28\">Gal. 3:28<\/a>."},{"v":"101001028","c":"On having dominion, see <a href=\"1.html#v26\">verse 26<\/a>. &bull; On being fruitful, it is becoming clear that those nations which are not fruitful whither away. But the meaning of fruitful here is not to be as fruitful as one possibly can with disregard for all other concerns, such as health, ability to raise up children, and such. On the other hand, it appears that the more people there are, the more life has improved, and that considerably. On birth control itself, assuming married couples, anything that is abortive is clearly sinful. Opinion differ on other methods. There are of course natural and not so natural methods. Is it healthy for females to take in chemicals, hormones, for a considerable portion of their lives? We don't really know yet, and those who take these are part of a scientific experiment on a grand scale. More natural methods seem a wiser choice for those who think it is not contrary to the will of God to avoid becoming pregnant. &bull; The Bible also says that children are the delight of old age, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/ps\/127.html#v3\">Psalm 127:3<\/a>, so anyone should think twice before robbing themselves of such delights. &bull; On if childbearing is sinful, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/lev\/12.html#v6\">Lev. 12:6<\/a>."},{"v":"101001029","c":"The command given here, to eat from every tree, was given before The Fall. There were no plants that could harm humans. There were no thorns and thistles. The author of the SAB links to \u201cBiblical Nonsense: Science to the Rescue,\u201d which appears to be a text written by someone with very little learning in Hebrew, the Bible and the sciences. &bull; On if Adam was allowed to eat from every tree: yes, all trees on the earth, except one tree specially planted in the Garden of Eden. Note that there is a restriction in this verse, Adam is not given every tree, but every tree, <em>in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed<\/em>. It is unsure if the tree of the knowledge of good and evil fit this definition, but if it did, I see no contradiction by God giving him every tree, that means every kind, on the earth, except a special one. For that conclusion to hold this verse should have added: \u201cevery single tree, no exceptions.\u201d &bull; On what we should eat: this command is given before The Fall and before the flood. Very different circumstances. &bull; On if it is OK to smoke marijuana: I think a facetious answer to a facetious question will do: smoking is not eating."},{"v":"101001030","c":"Indeed, all created animals were herbivores. The species we have now might have devolved into a different direction. There are many different species of bats nowadays, but many still eat <a href=\"http:\/\/www.batdetective.com\/batseat.htm\">only fruit<\/a>. On how blood drinking bats could have evolved, see <a href=\"http:\/\/creation.com\/the-dracula-connection-to-a-young-earth\">The Dracula connection to a young Earth<\/a>."},{"v":"101001031","c":"The author of the SAB claims that the universe is 13.7 billion years old. Depending on what decade you would have lived in, it would have varied from millions to billions to infinity. What will science assure us is the age of the universe in the next hundred years? &bull; But the author of the SAB makes a mistake in believing that creationist scientists do believe the universe to be 6,000 years old. Many young earth creationist scientists believe the earth to be 6,000 years old, but the universe <a href=\"http:\/\/creation.com\/how-can-distant-starlight-reach-us-in-just-6000-years\">to be billions of years old<\/a>. On the fourth day of creation, when God created the stars, the space around the earth was expanded, creating a white hole effect, which would cause time beyond the earth to run much faster, while not effecting time on earth. This solves the distant star light problem and does not violate known laws of physics. This theory is testable. For example all stars and galaxies move away from the earth. Secular scientists have to believe we are not special and affirm this holds for every point in the universe: i.e. wherever you are, every point in space would be receding from you. This is not true for this creationist model. &bull; On stars being formed: no one has ever witnessed that, scientists have no clue how stars could form in the first place, and there are simply no obervations of stars being formed.

No creation of the earth, the sun or moon, aquatic animals missing, etc. See <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tektonics.org\/jedp\/creationtwo.html\">Tektonics<\/a> for a comparison. &bull; So clearly this isn't about creation. This book is probably written by Adam, possibly on a clay tablet, see <a href=\"1.html#v1\">chapter 1:1<\/a>, and follows the first account. The first account is God telling Adam how the universe came into being, this is the account from Adam starting with his earliest memories. By way of introduction he states that there was no man, because he was the first."},{"v":"101002009","c":"The author of the SAB reads into these verses more than they are saying. The Hebrew does <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iclnet.org\/pub\/resources\/text\/m.sion\/hebrtens.htm\">not have a past tense<\/a>. &bull; I believe this story was originally written by Adam himself, possibly on a clay tablet. After the introduction explaining there was no man, the story continues in <a href=\"2.html#v7\">verse 7<\/a> with the creation of Adam. It then explains what went on before, i.e. why he was in the garden, and goes on to the climax, the first woman. &bull; On the \u201cmagic trees\u201d these trees were not magic in the sense that they conveyed some supernatural properties by themselves. The tree of of knowledge of good and evil could have been any tree, perhaps just a normal fruit bearing tree. The idea was that man was given freedom here to obey God or not. Without the possibility to obey, what reward could there be? Or as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/rom\/4.html#v15\">the apostle Paul says<\/a> (Rom. 4:15): \u201cfor where no law is, there is no transgression.\u201d So Adam was given an extremely simple command: don't eat from this particular tree. The punishment of death was conveyed by God and was not simply bodily death, but has a far more extensive meaning: man died internally, he has no longer the freedom to sin or not, but is delivered over to sin. Life is no longer free from death, but everything in this life is under curse, ending in death of the body, and eternal death in hell. &bull; A note of caution: although I previously described that Adam was given a simple command, this is too simplistic a view of this situation. The more accurate way is to say that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shortercatechism.com\/resources\/wsc\/wsc_012.html\">God entered into a covenant<\/a> with Adam."},{"v":"101002015","c":"The link supplied by the author of the SAB makes good points. But there is quite a difference between a Biblical view of nature and the environmentalists view. At the extreme end of their view we find that humanity is just a plague and the earlier it disappears, the better. The core philosophy of environmentalists is that humans have a destabilising effect on the environment, although not everyone takes that to its logical conclusion. So Bible believers can never be environmentalists as the word is currently used, and according to the philosophies held by environmentalists."},{"v":"101002017","c":"See <a href=\"1.html#v29\">chapter 1:29<\/a>."},{"v":"101002018","c":"Note that in this verse God talks about \u201c<em>the<\/em> man.\u201d This verse is about Adam in particular.

But the author of the SAB should simply read this verse as describing how the animals were created, from the ground, and unlike Adam without the breath of life. Just like the previous verse describes the conclusion reached, before the story is given. So read \u201cAnd out of the ground the LORD God formed them every beast\u201d as only saying that God had formed in the past. It does not describe they were created right here and now. The previous verse wouldn't make sense, because why would God talk about a help? It is because every animal had a help, they came in pairs it appears. &bull; And it may be a good reminder that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theology.edu\/hebrew\/hb07.htm\">Biblical Hebrew does not have tenses<\/a>."},{"v":"101002020","c":"The author of the SAB confuses animal kinds with speciation. They are very different things. The wolf and dog species are of the same kind. Lions and tigers are of one kind, and so on. Speciation hadn't happened here, only the original created kinds were present. <a href=\"http:\/\/creation.com\/ligers-and-wholphins-what-next\">Creationists estimate<\/a> there were fewer than 20,000 created kinds. These created kinds contained all genetic material we have. Speciation means that we get an animal with less variation, for example his hair is always white."},{"v":"101002021","c":"The author of the SAB can't contain himself. It's not easy to practise gospel doctrines you are supposedly on favour of, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/3jn\/1.html#v11\">3 John 1:11<\/a>. &bull; On when Eve was created, in <a href=\"1.html#v27\">chapter 1:27<\/a> we have only a short summary affirming both were created in the image of God. One is not less human than the other. In this account we have a personal recollection of Adam with more details. If we had only this we might think the female might somehow be subordinate. &bull; The author of the SAB also says that it was commonly believed that males have one less rib. He does not give any references to back up that claim. We can find the story in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Andreas_Vesalius#Skeletal_System\">Wikipedia<\/a>, but as usual there are no references. And it is peddled again <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Human_rib_cage#Number_of_ribs\">on another page<\/a>.

First of all, it is clear that the devil himself used a serpent here to speak to Eve, so it was not simply a serpent. As <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studylight.org\/com\/geb\/view.cgi?book=ge&chapter=3&verse=1\">John Gill explains<\/a>: <blockquote>the words therefore may be rendered, \"that serpent\"; that particular serpent, of which so much is spoken of afterwards; \"or the serpent was become\", or \"made more subtle\", that is, not naturally, but through Satan being in it, and using it in a very subtle manner, to answer his purposes, and gain his point: for though a real serpent, and not the mere form or appearance of one, is here meant, as is clear from this account, and the curse afterwards pronounced on it; yet not that only, but as possessed and used by Satan as an instrument of his to accomplish his designs, as is evident from its having the faculty of speech, and the use of reason, employed in a very artful and sophistic manner: nor is it rational to suppose that human nature, in the height of its glory and excellency, should be outwitted and seduced by a creature so inferior to it; besides, the Scriptures always ascribe the seduction of man to the devil; who, because he acted his deceitful part in and by the serpent, is called the serpent, and the old serpent, and the devil and Satan, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/2cor\/11.html#v3\">2 Cor. 11:3<\/a>.<\/blockquote> Secondly, if Eve had eaten and Adam not, there would not have been a Fall. The covenant of works was made with Adam, not Eve. I.e. if Adam had obeyed God, his descendants would not have a fallen nature, but would be as equally as Adam have had the ability to choose freely between good and evil. &bull; So Eve does not get the full blame. God starts with Adam, and then works his way backward, see <a href=\"3.html#v11\">verses 11-14<\/a>. And it wasn't about the bite, it was about believing the devil, and not believing God. She believed that the devil was right, that she would be as God. She did not believe God who had commanded not to eat from this tree. &bull; At the bottom of this chapter, the author of the SAB links to some fringe cults who believe that the account of The Fall says something completely different than it says. I won't comment on those, except to say it is clear that Cain was of the seed of Adam, see <a href=\"4.html#v1\">chapter 4:1<\/a>."},{"v":"101003006","c":"The author of the SAB interprets death in an extremely narrow sense: the death of the body.

For since we cannot comprehend him as he is, it is necessary that, for our sakes he should, in a certain sense, transform himself. That repentance cannot take place in God, easily appears from this single considerations that nothing happens which is by him unexpected or unforeseen. The same reasoning, and remark, applies to what follows, that God was affected with grief. Certainly God is not sorrowful or sad; but remains forever like himself in his celestial and happy repose: yet, because it could not otherwise be known how great is God's hatred and detestation of sin, therefore the Spirit accommodates himself to our capacity. Wherefore, there is no need for us to involve ourselves in thorny and difficult questions, when it is obvious to what end these words of repentance and grief are applied; namely, to teach us, that from the time when man was so greatly corrupted, God would not reckon him among his creatures; as if he would say, 'This is not my workmanship; this is not that man who was formed in my image, and whom I had adorned with such excellent gifts: I do not deign now to acknowledge this degenerate and defiled creature as mine.' Similar to this is what he says, in the second place, concerning grief; that God was so offended by the atrocious wickedness of men, as if they had wounded his heart with mortal grief: There is here, therefore, an unexpressed antithesis between that upright nature which had been created by God, and that corruption which sprung from sin.

It took a few months before lower lying mountain tops were visible from the ark says the next verse. Noah didn't go out of the ark, he had to look out of the windows and probably couldn't look at a steep down angle easily, so he had to look around him."},{"v":"101008007","c":"The Genesis story is only confusing if you are looking for contradictions that do not exist. On the animals that went into the Ark, see <a href=\"6.html#v19\">chapter 6:19<\/a>. &bull; On how long the Flood lasts, see <a href=\"7.html#v17\">chapter 7:17<\/a>. &bull; In this chapter Noah sends out two birds: first a raven, and sometime later a dove. The raven didn't return, but flew around the Ark until the earth was dry enough. The dove couldn't find a nesting place yet, so returned. And a week later Noah <a href=\"8.html#v11\">tried again<\/a> (verse 11). The reason Noah sent a raven first is that this bird feeds on carrion. So if the earth was dry enough and dead carcasses available, the bird would have flown away and not return, else it would have returned to the Ark. &bull; The author of the SAB mentions that these chapters consist of supposedly two separate accounts that were interwoven. This is based on a theory developed in the 19th century, the documentary hypothesis. This hypothesis does not need to refer to tangible artifacts, but every professor can make up sources as he sees fit. So every professor makes his own claims about what words came from what sources. Those supposed sources have never been found obviously. Apart from that this is claimed for no other book, it also dismissed the <a href=\"http:\/\/creation.com\/debunking-the-documentary-hypothesis\">clear structure of this portion of Genesis<\/a>, and not \u201cclumsily interwoven\u201d as the author of the SAB has hit."},{"v":"101008011","c":"The claim of the author of the SAB only makes sense if he believes the following: <ol> <li>The waters covered everything up to the highest level of trees.<\/li> <li>In seven days the waters had disappeared and a tree grown.<\/li> <\/ol> Which is indeed a very unlikely scenario and therefore not at all what is described here and completely at odds what every child would understand what is said here. &bull; First of all, where does the author of the SAB gets his claim from that the waters still covered the earth the first day the dove was sent out? The Bible asserts the contrary. Noah wouldn't have sent out a bird if the waters still covered the earth. So from the Ark the world appeared dry. But how would Noah know it was wise for him and the animals to leave the ark? So he used these birds to see if the earth was suitable again for animals. The earth was already dry as far as he began to see, <a href=\"8.html#v5\">verse 5<\/a>, and learnt from the raven that didn't return, <a href=\"8.html#v7\">verse 7<\/a>. A raven feeds on carrion, but a dove needs trees, so this was a test to see if trees had grown again and not only that, but also if leaves had appeared. &bull; On the olive tree: the author of the SAB wonders how it could have survived the flood. <a href=\"http:\/\/creation.com\/letters-to-the-editor-creation-181\">According to CMI<\/a>: <blockquote>In many tree species (including olives) broken pieces buried in soil or mud close to the surface can sprout another tree, the likely source of the olive leaf in Genesis.<\/blockquote> <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olive#Old_olive_trees\">Wikipedia says<\/a>: <blockquote>Its root system is very robust and capable of regenerating the tree even if the above-ground structure is destroyed. <\/blockquote> The tree would have been growing for some months, possibly four. Obviously it would not have been a fully grown fruit bearing tree. The dove probably got some leave from the baby shoots. &bull; Although I couldn't find a picture showing shoots about 4 months old, <a href=\"http:\/\/emp.byui.edu\/SATTERFIELDB\/Olive%20Tree\/olive%20tree%20horticulture.htm\">this page<\/a> contains images of shoots coming out at the sides of an old tree. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wildolive.co.uk\/tubshvat.htm\">This site<\/a> also has shoots coming up (no indication how old they are)."},{"v":"101008013","c":"Clearly the verb \u201cdrying up\u201d describes a process.

As this verse says \u201cthe waters were dried up from off the earth ... the face of the ground was dry.\u201d John Gill explains: <blockquote>the ground or surface of the earth looked dry; but was not so dry and hard as to bear heavy bodies, or the foot to tread on it, being soft and tender, through the water so long upon it, and had left mud and slime, not yet sufficiently hardened by the wind and sun to walk upon.<\/blockquote> In <a href=\"8.html#v14\">verse 14<\/a> we get God's perspective. God perceived the time when the earth was safe for humans and the animals.

And before that it took quite a while before the tops of the mountains were seen and the earth was dry. So there were quite a few months where plants, shrubs and trees could grow. So it wasn't the case, as the author of the SAB says, that one day the earth was covered in water, and the next day it was dry and everyone left the earth. The time between the Ark resting on Arafat (Wednesday, May 6) and animals leaving the ark (Thursday, December 18) was about 7 months (dates according to the reckoning of Bishop Usher). The Northern hemisphere would have had a full growing season. &bull; On the carnivores, the author of the SAB makes the typical evolutionist mistake that being a carnivore is a built-in behaviour. It's not. What we can eat is largely determined by the bacteria in our bowels. <a href=\"http:\/\/creation.com\/the-lion-that-wouldnt-eat-meat\">Lions can eat grass<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/creation.com\/air-attack\">herbivores can eat meat<\/a>.

If I create something from clay, I may destroy it. It's my property. Is someone's wife property in that sense? Clearly not. But a man can lay claim to his wife in some sense, like she can to him. That's the meaning here. Someone's wife is his, not another.

There were clear restrictions, and clear protections by the law. &bull; What happened here is that someone sold his time for six years for a single lump sum, to the person he would serve. Perhaps the servant had come indebted, or he wished to help his family or pay for medical expenses. His master pays a single sum, to the servant. The sum isn't paid to a slave trader. Slavery in the sense of enslaving people against their will was expressly forbidden, see <a href=\"21.html#v16\">verse 16<\/a>. &bull; Another situation is mentioned by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studylight.org\/com\/geb\/view.cgi?book=ex&chapter=21&verse=2\">John Gill<\/a>: someone being sold because of theft: to make repairs. There was no prison, which the Middle East would probably have viewed as a most inhumane form of punishment."},{"v":"102021004","c":"The servant's master may have had another servant and have given permission to his servant to marry her.

It's done voluntarily every day by hundreds of girls. This was also a transaction between equals: the servant was free, he had served his time, and the master was free to accept him or not."},{"v":"102021007","c":"First of all, selling your daughter doesn't mean she was sold as some kind of modern slave with little protection under the law. Secondly, who would sell his daughter? Not if you didn't have to we can be sure. &bull; The situation here is someone who was unable to care for his daughter, probably through poverty. Another family would take care for her by giving the parents a lump sum, which could be used to alleviate that poverty or pay of debts, and in return the girl would perform certain labours. &bull; Any hint of selling your daughter into slavery is completely unwarranted by this and subsequent verses, but of course useful to heap scorn on the Bible, truth being the least important of things. &bull; The phrase \u201cshe shall not go out as the menservants do\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studylight.org\/com\/geb\/view.cgi?book=ex&chapter=21&verse=7\">means that she got special treatment<\/a>: she was released upon puberty, in the jubilee, or upon death of her masters."},{"v":"102021010","c":"Although polygamy is regulated, it happened because of the hardness of their hearts, it is never blessed and it wasn't from the beginning."},{"v":"102021015","c":"God does not want children to die, but God wants sin punished. Is the author of the SAB advocating here that children can hit their parents without fear of punishment? Perhaps not, and the issue addressed here is the manner of punishment. &bull; Let's first look at <a href=\"http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/search?q=smite\">the definition of smiting<\/a>. One of its meanings is: \u201cto strike or hit hard, with or as with the hand, a stick, or other weapon: \u201d Another is: \u201cTo attack, damage, or destroy by or as if by blows.\u201d So smiting is not some minor attack, but a hard hitting one, with the intent to destroy. It is a serious attack. God considered this such a serious crime under the laws of Old Israel that the maximum punishment should be death. &bull; And one can wonder if Israel had more or less parents attacked by their children than countries with soft laws."},{"v":"102021016","c":"This verse says exactly the opposite as the author of the SAB has it! This verse condemns slavery, Capturing someone and selling him, i.e. slavery, is to be punished with death."},{"v":"102021017","c":"This is smiting with the tongue <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freegrace.net\/gill\/Exodus\/Exodus_21.htm\">as John Gill explains<\/a>: <blockquote>Though he does not smite them with his hand, or with any instrument in it, yet if he smites them with his tongue, reviles and reproaches them, speaks evil of them, wishes dreadful imprecations upon them, curses them by the name explained<\/blockquote>"},{"v":"102021020","c":"Slavery was forbidden, see <a href=\"21.html#v16\">verse 16<\/a>, so again, and again, this isn't about slaves, but about servants who have sold themselves voluntarily or were sold after having found out stealing and unable to make repayments. &bull; The question that is decided here: was this punishment the cause of death, or was death accidental. Any judge will need to separate cause and effect, and this verse gives some guidelines. It isn't about beating them so they die, as that would be pretty stupid after spending all that money on them. And secondly, the punishment was also the loss of labour: if indeed there was an effect between rod and death, the master lost labour, which was probably a significant amount of money."},{"v":"102021022","c":"As in <a href=\"21.html#v20\">verse 20<\/a>, how to determine if the effect of the miscarriage was caused by the fight or not? And what kind of punishment to exact? Surely the legal standing of a foetus is different than that of an adult. And this verse is the exact opposite of pro-choice, because pro-choice means you can kill a baby just fine. But here the foetus is treated as a person and a fine follows."},{"v":"102021024","c":"I wonder of the author of the SAB really has understood this verse. What is says is that the payment should match the crime. No death penalty for stealing: only an eye for an eye, not the entire body (i.e. the death penalty). A tooth for a tooth means only a tooth, your hand is not whacked off."},{"v":"102021026","c":"The author of the SAB claims that losing an eye or tooth is seen as more important than beating a slave to death. It isn't, obviously once the servant is dead, he cannot be set free. Secondly, this verse indicates that any form of punishment that results in physical disabilities would mean the freedom of the servant, basically guaranteeing no harsh forms of punishment were used as the penalty was the loss of the servant. Thirdly, if beating of the slave resulted in immediate death, it was simply murder."},{"v":"102021028","c":"This law is very similar to laws all over the world where for example a dog or shark is killed after it has attacked humans."},{"v":"102021029","c":"This law basically says that the instrument of death is not important when determining if someone is guilty of killing someone. Killing someone was taken extremely seriously. In many modern West European countries it has become a relatively small thing, a few years in prison at most, less than tax evasion."},{"v":"102021032","c":"On the word slave which the author of the SAB likes to use, see <a href=\"21.html#v4\">verse 4<\/a>. Note here that the worth of the servant, whether bought for 100 shekels or 1 penny, is fixed as thirty: each on of them has an intrinsic worth."},{"v":"102022003","c":"I really fail to understand why the author of the SAB things it is justice if someone steals, but doesn't make restitution. Locking up someone in prison for crimes like that is inhumane. It does not produce any good effect, except keeping this person off the streets for a while. Far better to return what was stolen. And being poor is not an excuse. If the thief has an able body, let him work. And yes, that's forced labour. But that's simply the result of the choice the thief made by stealing in the first place. &bull; Note that modern philosophers make similar points with regards to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lewrockwell.com\/rothbard\/rothbard145.html\">proper punishment for stealing<\/a>."},{"v":"102022016","c":"The Bible makes it very clear that sexual intercourse is marriage. Are you married if the marriage is not consummated? Prior to the no fault divorce laws that was an important consideration. &bull; So according to Biblical standards these persons were married at this point. However, what to do if the father was opposed and the maid under a certain age? In that case a divorce was allowed, but the dowry still had to be paid, as the maid would have to use this to secure her living. I fail to see what is particularly women unfriendly about this. The law, by its nature, must deal with things gone wrong."},{"v":"102022018","c":"There can be no doubt that magic was not OK.

Well, the day before the entire pond is covered of course, day 29.

After twenty five years the kids have grown up, married, and a couple has produced four children. If you start with seventy people after 100 years there will be 1,120 people. After two hundred years there will be 17,920 people. After three hundred years there will be 286,720 people. After four hundred years there will be 4,587,520 people. &bull; The last thing that needs to be discussed is if exponential growth is a correct assumption for population growth.

The professional police force? They didn't have one. Punishment was therefore meted out by relatives. &bull; But what about an accident? And how do we know it was an accident? Especially when relations between two persons were not so good, an accident might be interpreted as murder. And even if it was an accident, you still killed someone! So first of all, to make it clear it was an accident, one had to flee the scene towards the city of refuge, and quickly, else relatives or others might execute what they thought was the proper punishment. Secondly, emotions might cloud the judgement of the relative, it might simply be not safe and wise to stay at the scene to explain all. &bull; Inside the city of refuge, accidental killers could not summarily be killed for what might have been thought, or appeared to be, murder. Courts were setup in these six cities and could establish the case. &bull; And perhaps there were cases were it might not be so clear what happened.

And the way to do away evil is to do against the false witness as the false witness tried to do against the righteous man.

There were two options then: she could be sent home or become this man's wife. As there were then thirty days for her to bewail her father and mother, what if this man changed his mind in those thirty days? Would he still be required to marry her? No says Moses, she may be sent home, but as she has been humbled, i.e. taken captive and her head shaved, she was allowed to depart freely. &bull; The author of the SAB's reading cannot be correct as his reading doesn't explain at all what would be the procedure if this man didn't desire to marry her after all, and doesn't explain why this woman was not given a letter of divorce. &bull; When this woman was married, this man and woman became man and wife, with all protections and obligations that entailed.

That's simply made up by himself. &bull; To understand what happens in this chapter, we first need to know Mosaic law as it applied to Old Testament Israel.

What Noami and Ruth didn't know is that there was another kinsman, nearer to them, <a href=\"3.html#v12\">verse 12<\/a>. Boaz knew that, but they didn't. &bull; So that is why Naomi suggested that Ruth lay at the feet of Boaz. It was a sign of subjection. Boaz didn't need to marry her, she was at his mercy. Boaz didn't think Ruth came to frolick with him as he knew she was a virtuous woman, <a href=\"3.html#v11\">verse 11<\/a>. Ruth indeed makes it known to Boaz that she wishes to marry him. Boaz might even have been in love with her, but he couldn't say a thing, because there was a next of kin that had more right to her than he had. To me it seems a classic love story, properly understood. &bull; And so it happened.

The Lord withdraw his protection, because of the continuing sins of Israel. &bull; And it is not the issue of the census that was wrong, but as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gospelcom.net\/eword\/comments\/2samuel\/gill\/2samuel24.htm\">John Gill says<\/a>: <blockquote>so that this appears to be done not through any urgent necessity, but merely out of curiosity, and to gratify the pride of his heart, and please himself with the thought of ruling such a numerous people, and brag of their numbers to other nations, and place his confidence therein; and no wonder it was displeasing to the Lord.<\/blockquote>"},{"v":"110024009","c":"The number mentioned here differs from the number mentioned in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/1chr\/21.html#v5\">1 Chr. 21:5<\/a>.

According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/1chr\/27.html#v1\">1 Chr. 27:1<\/a> twenty four thousand of those came and left every month. Twelve months times twenty four thousand makes 288,000. Add 12,000 officers and you have the 300,000 difference between the two numbers. &bull; The difference between the number of man in Judah is probably a simple rounding issue. &bull; The author of the SAB also mentions that the number of man seemed to be ridiculously high compared to the army of the United States. But you should never compare apples to oranges. Israel didn't have conscripts in those time. Clearly this number indicates all the man in Israel, probably from twenty upwards, and perhaps only counting the able-bodied.

But even this interpretation is too broad. The Israelites used the high places to sacrifice to the Lord as well, see <a href=\"3.html#v2\">chapter 3:2<\/a>. When the temple was built, they should no longer have sacrificed anywhere else, but they still did. So when we read in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/2chr\/14.html#v5\">2 Chr. 14:5<\/a> that the high places were removed it is the high places where they sacrificed to the idols. If we compare the texts they are subtly different. This text just says high places.

But as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ministerturnsatheist.org\/biblecontradictions.html\">Joe E. Holman<\/a> points out, that's not a very good defense as Asa reigned over Judah, not over Israel. That is true, but not completely, Asa took some cities in Israel, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/2chr\/15.html#v8\">2 Chr. 15:8<\/a>, but even that verse says that he removed the idols from those places as well. &bull; That the high places were not only used to sacrifice to idols, but that high places were also used by the Israelites to sacrifice to the Lord, is clear from other verses where high places were used to sacrifice. For example God commanded Gideon to sacrifice at a high place, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/jg\/6.html#v26\">Jg. 6:26<\/a>. We read about it in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/1sam\/9.html#v12\">1 Sam. 9:12<\/a>. That it was an accepted practice till the building of the temple is clear from <a href=\"3.html#v2\">chapter 3:2<\/a>, but Solomon is criticised for it <a href=\"3.html#v3\">chapter 3:3<\/a>. We see the same with Asa's son Josafat. He walked in the way of his father, but also didn't take away the high places where the Jews sacrificed to the Lord, <a href=\"22.html#v43\">chapter 22:43<\/a>.

Aijalon is indeed a city of Dan as is Gathrimmon. But it does not seem that the intention of the author of Chronicles was to copy Joshua entirely, see for example <a href=\"6.html#v60\">verse 60<\/a> where the author knows that there were thirteen cities, but just mentions three cities in that verse. In the subsequent verses he mentions another eight cities that were given to the son of Kohath, and doesn't mention the remaining two. In previous times people did usually not quote literally, but they tended to quote the meaning of an author. See for example ``<a href=\"http:\/\/www.spotlightministries.org.uk\/inner.htm\">The Bible Inerrant and Infallible?<\/a>'': <blockquote>It should be recognised that the procedures that people use when quoting others differ from culture to culture. In the modern Western world we are used to quoting a person's exact words. In New Testament times however, when people quoted others, it was more common to just give an accurate representation of the content of what a person had said, and not necessarily quote them word for word. <\/blockquote> So in this case the author just copies some bits, and leaves out other bits. We can see a bit of a break in the text, where Shechem is mentioned as the city of refuge, but after that the bits of Joshua are left out, for example the author here doesn't mention the next few cities in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/jos\/21.html#v22\">Jos. 21:22<\/a>. The next city <a href=\"6.html#v68\">mentioned here<\/a> (verse 68) is Jokmeam, which is mentioned much later in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/jos\/21.html#v34\">Jos. 21:34<\/a>. Then it continues in this verse with other cities the tribe of Kohath, the Levites, received, which happened to belong to Dan. &bull; As this is not an exact quotation I think it is entirely unwarranted to claim that the author here combines <a href=\"6.html#v66\">cities which belonged to Ephraim<\/a> (verse 66) with the cities mentioned afterwards.

Perhaps he mentions only the sons who had sons themselves, or whose descendants could still be found. &bull; If I say I have a son called Peter, and you find out that I have another son as well, did I lie?

Israel had sinned, and the punishment for sin is death, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/rom\/6.html#v23\">Rom. 6:23<\/a>.

By what means could it maintain itself unmoved, while the heavens above are in constant rapid motion, did not its Divine Maker fix and establish it?<\/blockquote> But it's unfair to accuse Calvin of not accepting an idea the scientific consus had not adopted until long after as David Wootton writes in \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.inventionofscience.com\/\">The Invention of Science<\/a>\":<blockquote>For the first hundred years after the publication of Copernicus's book in 1543 only a fairly limited number of specialists were familiar with the details of his arguments, which were only generally accepted in the second half of the seventeenth century.<\/blockquote> But the issue here isn't what Calvin thought, but what the text actually says. It is not probable to read this exclamation as a scientific description. The intend of the psalmist is to compare land and sea with God's might. In <a href=\"93.html#v1\">verse one<\/a> (verse 1) the psalmist mentions the earth: it doesn't move, i.e. the ground doesn't shake, it is firm.

Unlike land, the sea does move. Waves can be high and in great turmoil, appear unstoppable. But <a href=\"93.html#v4\">God is mightier<\/a> (verse 4). &bull; The psalmist concludes with God's testimonies: the scriptures are sure. We can trust them. The whole psalm is very similar to <a href=\"19.html\">chapter 19<\/a> where also nature is described in the first part, and God's kingdom in the second. &bull; Note that John Gill takes this entire psalm as a description of the future kingdom of God, of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studylight.org\/com\/geb\/view.cgi?book=ps&chapter=93&verse=1\">the world to come<\/a>."},{"v":"119096004","c":"In <a href=\"96.html#v5\">the next verse<\/a> (verse 5) we see that the psalmist doesn't believe there is more than one god.

But that is of course not the only way a rod can be used. &bull; But let's turn this around: if you don't beat your children with a rod, is that a sure sign of parental love? What if your children go astray, lying or stealing, would a good father not try to bring them back on the straight and narrow path? &bull; What good father would beat a faithful son? And what good father would use his rod on someone who isn't his son? Using the rod in a measured way is a sure sign of love. When the child needs correction, and the father doesn't give it, that's a sure sign of neglect. It is a sign of abnegating the responsibility a father has to see his children grow up into good citizens. &bull; The ones who oppose physical correction might believe that children don't need correction. The Bible tells us otherwise. We are born in sin and in iniquity. We are not born as good, obedient children who will automatically turn into good citizens. It is indeed who spares the rod, who neglects his responsibility to correct his children, and if necessary using physical means, that hates his children. A father should love his children so much that he takes the effort to correct them. And not be like Eli, who did not restrain his sons, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/1sam\/3.html#v13\">1 Sam. 3:13<\/a>. &bull; One might ask if we must use a rod: but that is not what Solomon says.

In countries where physical force against children has been outlawed, such as New Zealand, such actions could see a parent in jail.

Men will appear before the judgement seat.

So how can the author of the SAB see any comparison between the \u201cright and morning star\u201d in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/rev\/22.html#v16\">Rev. 22:16<\/a> and \u201cO Lucifer, son of the morning\u201d? I assume the author of the SAB has been influenced by a modern translation, for example <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blueletterbible.org\/Bible.cfm?b=Isa&c=14&v=12&t=NIV#12\">the NIV reads here<\/a>: \u201cO morning star, son of the dawn!\u201d &bull; But the Hebrew word which the NIV translates with star occurs only once in the Bible <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blueletterbible.org\/lang\/lexicon\/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H1966&t=KJV\">if read as a proper noun<\/a>, and refers to the King of Babylon. But at other places it is read as a verb, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blueletterbible.org\/lang\/Lexicon\/Lexicon.cfm?strongs=H3213&t=KJV\">translated with howl<\/a>. So one would read: \u201cHow art thou fallen from heaven, howl, son of the morning!\u201d &bull; But regardless if you read this as a proper noun or verb, it definitely does not mean star. Hebrew has a perfectly valid and entirely different <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blueletterbible.org\/lang\/lexicon\/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H3556&t=KJV\">word for star<\/a>, which would have been used if star was the right translation."},{"v":"123014021","c":"Children are not punished for the sins of their fathers, unless they walk in the way of their fathers, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/ex\/20.html#v5\">Ex. 20:5<\/a>.

It is has obvious similarities to Israel and Solomon's temple, but it is not the same. It has never been understood to be a command of God to follow its dimensions and instructions. For example this temple is not inside the city, but <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studylight.org\/com\/geb\/view.cgi?book=ezek&chapter=40&verse=0\">some distance from it<\/a>. When the second temple was built, Ezekiel's description and dimensions were not its guideline.

This was indeed the first year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar if we just count as the Bible counts. And the first year of Jehoiakim starts in 610 BC. As our years don't fit nicely into the reigns of the kings (different starting month), <a href=\"http:\/\/creationontheweb.com\/images\/pdfs\/other\/timeline_of_the_bible.pdf\">the third year is 607 BC<\/a>. &bull; Now to the supposed bad history. The author of the SAB quotes here Farrell Till as saying that the first invasion was at 597 BC, which would be the last year of Jehoiakim. Farrell Till concludes this from Babylonian records. And Farrell Till makes a second claim, namely that Nebuchadnezzar became king in 605 BC, two years after the Bible says he besieged Jerusalem. All these dates can be a bit confusing, so let me give a time line below (all dates in BC), and according to Ussher's chronology: &bull; 610: Jehoiakim is made king by Pharaoh Nechoh, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/2kg\/23.html#v34\">2 Kg. 23:34<\/a>. &bull; 608: Nebuchadnezzar is made viceroy. &bull; 607: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carchemish\">battle of Carchemish<\/a>, where Egypt was defeated (fourth year of Jehoiakim), see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/jer\/46.html#v2\">Jer. 46:2<\/a>. &bull; 607: first siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar; Daniel and his friends taken and brought to Babylon, start of the 70 years of captivity. &bull; 605: death of Nabopolassar, father of Nebuchadnezzar. &bull; 604: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/2kg\/24.html#v1\">Jehoiakim rebels<\/a> (2 Kg. 24:1), it takes Nebuchadnezzar a few years to be able to respond. &bull; 600: Nebuchadnezzar invades Judah, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/2kg\/24.html#v2\">2 Kg. 24:2<\/a>. &bull; 599: second siege of Jerusalem; Jehoiakim's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/jer\/27.html#v20\">son Jeconiah, also Jehoiachin, was taken to Babylon<\/a> (Jer. 27:20), see also <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/2kg\/24.html#v12\">2 Kg. 24:12<\/a>. &bull; 589: last siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. &bull; 588: destruction of the first temple. &bull; Note that secular history gives 586 BC as the date that Solomon's temple was destroyed. And note that Bishop Ussher's starts the reign of Nebuchadnezzar two years earlier than secular history. &bull; We know the relationship between the reign of Nebuchadnezzar and Jehoiakim, and this allows us to match their reigns. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/jer\/25.html#v1\">Jer. 25:1<\/a> the fourth year of Jehoiakim falls within the first year of Nebuchadnezzar. From this verse we know that Nebuchadnezzar's reign began during the third year of Jehoiakim. &bull; So this allows us to solve the second \u201ccontradiction\u201d claimed by Mr. Till: he compares Ussher's chronology as used in many Bible dictionaries with dates used by secular historians, and so obtains his contradiction that Nebuchadnezzar wasn't even king. In secular history, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jehoiakim\">Jehoiakim begins his reign in 609<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nebuchadrezzar_II\">Nebuchadnezzar begins his reign at 605<\/a>. But secular dates are simply wrong, as the Bible does not contradict itself and internally aligns the reigns of these two kings perfectly and consistently. It's only when we start using dates obtained by some method outside the Bible that we can obtain a contradiction. &bull; It is correct that Nebuchadnezzar's father died in 605 BC. When that happened Nebuchadnezzar became sole ruler. But from the Bible we know that as viceroy he reigned already 2 years before that. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.answersingenesis.org\/creation\/v20\/i2\/archbishop.asp\">It is the normal procedure in the Bible<\/a> to count the reign of a king from the first year that he became a viceroy. &bull; This also explains why he was in Jerusalem in his first year. If he had become king, he probably would not have ventured too far outside his realm in the first year, but would be establishing his power base in his home country and close at home. But because his father still reigned, he was able to make fame for himself by venturing abroad to obtain glory and loot. &bull; There is one issue that might seem contradictory: from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/jer\/46.html#v2\">Jer. 46:2<\/a> we know that the battle of Carchemish was in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, while this verse seems to say that in the third year of Jehoiakim we find Nebuchadnezzar before Jerusalem, which happened after the battle of Carchemish. But it we read this verse correctly, it says that Nebuchadnezzar came in the third year, that is, he left with his army at the end of the third year of Jehoiakim. From <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/jer\/46.html#v2\">Jer. 46:2<\/a> we know when he arrived: in the beginning of the fourth year of Jehoiakim. &bull; A different resolution is offered by Mark S. Haughwout, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.markhaughwout.com\/Bible\/Dating_Daniel.html\">who claims<\/a>: <blockquote>This apparent discrepancy with Daniel\u2019s account above is actually a cultural difference of dating systems. Jeremiah, living in the land of Israel, naturally uses the Israeli dating system, which would place Jehoiakim's fourth year in 604 BC. Daniel, using the Babylonian system, places Jehoiakim's third year in 604 BC. The Babylonians considered a king\u2019s first year to start on the first New Years day in his reign.<\/blockquote> Having established the date of the siege, let us have a look at the claim that the first siege of Jerusalem was only in 597. This is unlikely. If we look at the Biblical record, we see that Pharaoh Nechoh was expanding his kingdom to the North and East, something <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livius.org\/ne-nn\/nineveh\/nineveh02.html\">the Babylonian Chronicles also record<\/a>. On his way back from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Harran\">Harran<\/a>, Pharaoh Nechoh disposed the king in Jerusalem and installed Jehoiakim, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/2kg\/23.html#v34\">2 Kg. 23:34<\/a>. Farrell Till would make us believe that it took more then 10 years for Nebuchadnezzar to respond to this act of Pharaoh Nechoh. But this act of Pharaoh Nechoh is actually the reason we see Nebuchadnezzar before Jerusalem! In his first year as viceroy, he begins with his campaign to defeat Pharaoh, which he did convincingly at Carchemish. Afterwards he marches south to attack Pharaoh's allies and dispose his vassals. And that is why we find him before Jerusalem at this time and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.conservapedia.com\/Nebuchadnezzar_II#Viceroy\">Daniel and his friends were taken<\/a> to Babylon. His venture south ends with the full retreat of Pharaoh, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/2kg\/24.html#v7\">2 Kg. 24:7<\/a>. &bull; So the first siege was in 607, the second siege was in 599 (not 597 as secular history has it), and the third and last in 589 BC."},{"v":"127001008","c":"Daniel's issue with the wine was not that it contained alcohol.

The fact that this book gets this name right already verifies its accuracy. No other historian gives the name of the last king of Babel (except Baruch and Josephus who clearly depend on Daniel). Not one! So how could Daniel have known this name, unless he had been there? The walls of the palace that contained his name were destroyed within half a century after his death, only to be dug up thousands of years later. &bull; Second, the title. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tektonics.org\/guest\/danielblast.html\">The name contains the title<\/a>. It contains three parts: Bel-sar-usur: <blockquote>the name is expressed by three monograms, the first signifying the god Bel; the second, shar, a king; and the third being the same sign which terminates the name of Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar, Nergalshareser<\/blockquote> Therefore <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tektonics.org\/guest\/danielblast.html\">Raymond Dougherty, an eminent scholar in this field, points out<\/a>: <blockquote>Of all the non Babylonian records dealing with the situation at the close of the Neo-Babylonian empire the fifth chapter of Daniel ranks next to cuneiform literature in accuracy so far as outstanding events are concerned. The Scriptural account may be interpreted as excelling because it employs the name Belshazzar, because it attributes royal power to Belshazzar, and because it recognizes that a dual rulership existed in the kingdom. Babylonian cuneiform documents of the sixth century B.C. furnish clear-cut evidence of the correctness of these three basic historical nuclei contained in the Biblical narrative dealing with the fall of Babylon.<\/blockquote> So he certainly can be called king. Note that Daniel does not say he was the next king. That is an interpolation by sceptics. From the fact that Belshazzar can only make him third in the kingdom, we find a clear indication that he shared power. &bull; So that leaves us with the word \u201cson\u201d. The author of the SAB complains that he had no genetic relationship to Nebuchadnezzar. This word is used in two ways: <ol> <li>Nebuchadnezzar is called the father of Belshazzar when Daniel describes the setting of this event in <a href=\"5.html#v2\">verse 2<\/a>, by the queen, <a href=\"5.html#v11\">verse 11<\/a>, by Belshazzar himself, <a href=\"5.html#v11\">verse 11<\/a>, and by Daniel, <a href=\"5.html#v18\">verse 18<\/a>.<\/li> <li>Belshazzar is called the son of Nebuchadnezzar by Daniel, <a href=\"5.html#v22\">verse 22<\/a>.<\/li> <\/ol> So everyone is calling Nebuchadnezzar the father of Belshazzar. And indeed, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tektonics.org\/guest\/danielblast.html\">this was common usage<\/a> all over the Middle East: <blockquote>This claim ignores the ancient usage of the terms 'son' or 'father' in that it often referred to a successor in the same office whether or not there was a blood relationship. Thus in the Egyptian story, 'King Cheops and the Magicians, Prince Khephren came to pass in the time of thy father, King Neb-ka.' Actually Neb-ka belonged to the Third Dynasty, a full century before the time of Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty. &bull; In Assyria a similar practice was reflected in the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III, which refers to King Jehu (the exterminator of the whole dynasty of Omri) as 'the son of Omri.' Kitchen (1966) shows that here \"father' equals 'predecessor'; he cites several examples of how the ANE dealt with geneologies -- he notes that the most extreme example can be found where the Egyptian King Tirhakah (of the 25th dynasty) referred to Sesostris III (of the 12th dynasty, c. 1880 B.C.), a difference of 1,200 years! &bull; Textual (non-Biblical) evidence reveals that \"son\" was used at least 12 different ways in the ancient Orient, and \"father\" was used at least 7 different ways.<\/blockquote>"},{"v":"127005005","c":"The author of the SAB was there and can confirm it did not happen?

First of all, it is utterly unclear what other races are meant here, if we read this verse as the author of the SAB does. Nothing specific is mentioned. Is it everyone that's not of Ephraim, so mixing with the other tribes, such as Judah or Benjamin, is forbidden? Or is it forbidden to mix with other races that had Abraham as their father such as the Ishmaelites?

Matthew just quotes their interpretation which probably was broadly accepted.

Of course not, that can only be said of God. &bull; But to the two particulars the author of the SAB raises: <ol> <li>According to the author of the SAB, the phrase \"Bethlehem Ephratah\" in Micah 5:2 refers not to a town, but to a clan.\u201d The clan is supposedly a reference to Caleb's second wife Ephrath (or Ephrataha), an otherwise obscure woman mentioned only in passing in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/1chr\/2.html#v19\">1 Chr. 2:19<\/a>. Her first son was Hur who according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/1chr\/4.html#v4\">1 Chr. 4:4<\/a> was the father of Bethlehem. &bull; Caleb was of the tribe of Judah, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/num\/13.html#v6\">Num. 13:6<\/a>, and so the Messiah would be. So this reference to a \u201cclan\u201d is also a reference to the tribe, that is correct. &bull; The reference \u201cfather of Bethlehem\u201d in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/1chr\/4.html#v4\">1 Chr. 4:4<\/a> does not refer to a person, but to a city. The meaning is founding father. Bethlehem means \u201chouse of bread,\u201d no one calls their son a house. The word Bethlehem always refers to a place, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/gen\/35.html#v19\">Gen. 35:19<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/gen\/48.html#v7\">Gen. 48:7<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/ru\/2.html#v4\">Ruth 2:4<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blueletterbible.org\/search\/translationResults.cfm?Criteria=Bethlehem&t=KJV&sf=5\">many others<\/a>. &bull; It appears the name of the place was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/gen\/35.html#v19\">first called Ephrath<\/a> (Gen. 35:19) (so it's not named after Caleb's second wife). So the phrase Bethlehem Ephratah simply refers to a place, using both the old and new name. From the meaning of Bethlehem it is already clear it is a place.<\/li> <li>Secondly, given the ending of this verse, it is clear this cannot refer to some military leader. Christ is willing and able to deliver his people from their enemies, and in that sense he is indeed a military leader. In what sense this prophecy still will be fulfilled, I do not know.<\/li> <\/ol>"},{"v":"202005006","c":"Self defence is now cruelty and injustice?

So it is quite unlikely that Luke just keeps on mentioning names and places and well-known facts in order to trip himself up. &bull; The first thing that should be mentioned is that Luke very carefully wrote that this was the <em>first<\/em> census. So there was another one, probably one well-known and Luke wants to distinguish this taxing from that one everyone knew about. And there was indeed a second taxing, a very well-known one, mentioned by Josephus in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ccel.org\/j\/josephus\/works\/ant-18.htm\">the Antiquities<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ccel.org\/j\/josephus\/works\/war-2.htm\">the Jewish Wars<\/a> (Book 2, Chapter 8 and 17). This census was taken in 6 AD by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/lk\/translation\">Quirinius<\/a>, a figure well attested in historical records. Quirinius and Cyrenius are the same person (Cyrenius is a badly chosen translation from Greek, which is just the Greek spelling for the Roman name). The census of 6 AD almost led to open revolt and was the impetus for founding the party of the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zealots\">Zealots<\/a>. The founder of the party, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Judas_the_Galilean\">Judas the Galilean<\/a>, and this second taxing is mentioned by Luke in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/acts\/5.html#v37\">Acts 5:37<\/a>. &bull; Luke is being accused of contradicting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/mt\/2.html#v1\">Matthew<\/a> (Matthew 2:1) and <a href=\"1.html#v5\">even himself...<\/a> (Luke 1:5). The latter is of course already indication that such accusations are pretty silly. The arguments for reading 6 AD in this verse are as follows: <ol> <li>The first taxing (census) of Judea happened in 6 AD, and there were none before, so the taxing mentioned by Luke must logically refer to 6 AD.<\/li> <li>Quirinius wasn't governor of Syria at that time, but was in 6 AD, so again this verse must refer to 6 AD.<\/li> <\/ol> Census taking was a common feature of life under the Romans and according to history introduced by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Servius_Tullius\">Servius Tullius<\/a> (578-535 BC), the sixth king of ancient Rome. The <a href=\"http:\/\/classics.mit.edu\/Augustus\/deeds.html\">Res Gestae<\/a>, the Deeds of the Divine Augustus, records three such world-wide censuses taken by Augustus (deed 8). One of them was in 8BC. If this might have taken some time to implement and execute all across the empire, this might have reached Judea around 5BC, and be the one Luke mentions. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ccel.org\/j\/josephus\/works\/ant-14.htm\">Josephus records<\/a> (Antiquities, book 14, chapter 11) that Judea was already taxed by the Romans in 44 BC: <blockquote>Cassius came from Rome into Syria, in order to receive the [army that lay in the] camp at Apamia; and having raised the siege, he brought over both Bassus and Marcus to his party. He then went over the cities, and got together weapons and soldiers, and laid great taxes upon those cities; and he chiefly oppressed Judea, and exacted of it seven hundred talents:<\/blockquote> So the taxing mentioned by Luke was clearly not the first taxing of Judea by the Romans. That brings us to the second point. &bull; Let's first look at the translation. Many commentators mention that this verse can be translated as: \u201cthis was the first taxing before Cyrenius was governor of Syria.\u201d Which would remove the difficulty. However, no translation I have examined does actually translate this verse that way. &bull; So I take the meaning of this verse that this was the first taxing by Quirinius, and that Quirinius also did a second one, the one of 6 AD. In the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Census_of_Quirinius\">Aemilius Secundus<\/a> inscription we find Quirinius called Caesar's legate in Syria as well as ordering a census. There is no date on this inscription, but it is not unlikely that it refers to a period before 6 AD. &bull; The last remark is that Luke calls Quirinius hegemon, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Census_of_Quirinius\">according to Wikipedia<\/a>: <blockquote>used in ancient Greek to refer to varying forms of \"governing\", and could apply to other contexts of wielding authority besides the specific office of provincial governor, contexts fitting for Quirinius throughout his notable career.<\/blockquote> The word for governor would have been <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Legate\">legatus<\/a>. The governors in Syria were Sentius Saturninus from 9 to 6 BC, and after that Publius Quintilius Varus until at least April 4 BC. Between 4 and 1 BC it is not known who governed Syria. So Quirinius could have been governor de jure in the transition from Saturnius to Varus or perhaps after. &bull; See also \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/creationevolutiondesign.blogspot.com\/2006\/06\/re-where-does-cyrenius-fit-into-your_29.html\">Where does Cyrenius fit into your harmonization of Matthew &amp; Luke<\/a>.\u201d So although the matter cannot be settled fully, any claims that Luke was mistaken are entirely premature to say the least."},{"v":"203002004","c":"See <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/mt\/2.html#v11\">Matthew 2:11<\/a>."},{"v":"203002010","c":""},{"v":"203002014","c":"See <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/mt\/10.html#v34\">Matthew 10:34<\/a>."},{"v":"203002021","c":"That relic businesses deserves indeed every ridicule."},{"v":"203002022","c":"Jesus did not come to abolish the law, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/mt\/5.html#v17\">Matthew 5:17<\/a>.

Illness came in the world with death, and God was not it's cause, but the creature to whom God had given a free will, to choose good and to choose evil, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/gen\/2.html#v16\">Gen. 2:16-17<\/a>.

And they will be judged for mankind see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/mt\/25.html#v41\">Matthew 25:41<\/a>.

The author of the SAB asserts that the meaning of \u201cThe law and the prophets were until John\u201d is that the law and the prophets are now abolished. In the next verse Jesus says they're not. Voila, a contradiction. It is an extremely low blow to give a meaning to a phrase it doesn't have in order to let Jesus contradict himself. Because the meaning of \u201cThe law and the prophets were until John\u201d isn't that they were abolished. Jesus explicitly denies that it has that meaning <a href=\"16.html#v17\">in the next verse<\/a> (verse 17)! The meaning is simply that the law and the prophets spoke of things as under a shadow.

But you will have to give account what you did with what God gave you, be it talents or riches. In <a href=\"16.html#v21\">verse 21<\/a> it is clear that the rich man didn't care about the poor Lazarus at all. He didn't gave him any of his abundance. Lazarus had to do with what fell from the table, i.e. what was thrown away. When Lazarus became ill, the rich man didn't help him either, but the dogs had to lick his wounds. And lastly we very clearly see that being rich wasn't the cause of him going to hell in <a href=\"16.html#v30\">verse 30<\/a>.

Such was the interpretation which Tertullian (c. 200) gave to this passage. \"Having been washed,\" he writes, \u201cin the water by the angel, we are prepared for the Holy Spirit.\u201d Similarly, Didymus (c 379) states that the pool was \"confessedly an image of baptism\" and the angel troubling the water \u201ca forerunner of the Holy Spirit.\u201d And the remarks of Chrysostom (c. 390) are to the same effect. These writers, at least, appear firmly convinced that John 5:3b-4 was a genuine portion of the New Testament text.

As Jesus even invited Thomas to do so, see <a href=\"20.html#v27\">verse 27<\/a>, the answer is yes. As Jesus even allows the women to touch his feet, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/mt\/28.html#v9\">Matthew 28:9<\/a>, the author of the SAB is also incorrect in his speculation that the touch of a woman would somehow defile him. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ccel.org\/ccel\/calvin\/calcom35.x.iii.html\">Calvin explains why Mary Magdalene was forbidden to touch him<\/a>: <blockquote>as it was necessary for removing doubt, he unquestionably did not forbid them to touch him, but, perceiving that their attention was too much occupied with embracing his feet, he restrained and corrected that immoderate zeal. They fixed their attention on his bodily presence, and did not understand any other way of enjoying his society than by conversing with him on the earth. We ought, therefore, to conclude, that they were not forbidden to touch him, until Christ saw that, by their foolish and unreasonable desire, they wished to keep him in the world.<\/blockquote> The author of the SAB also asks if Jesus is God. The argument is probably that by saying \u201cmy God\u201d Jesus is saying he isn't God. But we have to look at the whole of sentence. When Jesus says he goes to his Father, he doesn't say <em>our<\/em> Father. The relationship between him and the Father is very different between the disciples and God. God is their Father by adoption, but God is Christ's Father by nature. And so is the relation between Christ and God and us and God. Christ doesn't say I go to <em>our<\/em> God, but to my God. Christ was God, but had humbled himself as a servant, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/phil\/2.html#v7\">Phil. 2:7<\/a>. So God was Christ's God by his office as mediator, and our God by creation. &bull; What Christ indicates by expressing himself in this manner is that through his work, and planted in him, we are made partakers of the blessings of Christ. By our new creation God has become our God again and this time as our Father as well."},{"v":"204020019","c":"Our disciples were Jews as well... And the Jews just had killed their master, no wonder they were afraid. &bull; Jesus appeared first to the eleven, or ten actually, on Sunday night.

From the other Gospel writers we know that he described an event that happened a week or two after the event described here. &bull; The author of the SAB also suggests that Jesus could walk through walls. There is no indication in the gospels that Jesus walked through a wall, but his body did no longer have the physical limitations we are subject to, so He seems to have been able to appear at different places without travelling."},{"v":"204020020","c":"Initially the disciples were frightened when they saw Jesus, but glad afterwards. &bull; John gives a very short account of the fuller account we find <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/lk\/24.html#v37\">in Luke<\/a> (Luke 24:37-41). As we can <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/lk\/24.html#v37\">read in Luke<\/a> (Luke 24:37), initially they feared, upon which <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/lk\/24.html#v39\">he showed them his hands<\/a> (Luke 24:39-40).

Perhaps else he couldn't take this shot? &bull; The author of the SAB reads hell as meaning the place of the damned. But that is not the meaning of the word hell in this verse nor in many others. The Greek word used here is Hades. It is the word used by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.septuagint.net\/\">the Septuagint<\/a> (LXX) translators when they translated the Hebrew word <a href=\"http:\/\/cf.blueletterbible.org\/lang\/lexicon\/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H07585&Version=kjv\">Sheol<\/a>. We have to consider the Hebrew as well, because Peter here quotes <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/ps\/16.html#v10\">Ps. 16:10<\/a>. The Hebrew word always means grave, or the place of the dead. It never means hell. For example Job desired to be in Sheol, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/job\/14.html#v13\">Job 14:13<\/a>, surely Job did not mean to say he would rather be in hell fire and torment! What Job means here that it would be better to depart from this life and to be with God, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/job\/19.html#v26\">Job 19:26-27<\/a>. &bull; The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zhubert.com\/bible?source=greek&verseref=Job+14:13\">Septuagint translates the word Sheol<\/a> in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/job\/14.html#v13\">Job 14:13<\/a> with Hades. And there are many more locations in the Old Testament that could be cited for similar proof. &bull; So the meaning of Sheol means the abode of the death. And Hades means that as well. Even in Homerus. We read there about expressions as \u201cHe shall knock at the gates of Hades,\u201d which should not be taken literally of course, but simply as meaning \u201cHe shall die, \u201d go to the grave. &bull; So the meaning here is that Jesus soul was not left in the grave. But we can say more about the word soul. The Greek word uses here is <a href=\"http:\/\/cf.blueletterbible.org\/lang\/lexicon\/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G5590&Version=kjv\">psyche<\/a>. It is the translation of the Hebrew word <a href=\"http:\/\/cf.blueletterbible.org\/lang\/lexicon\/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H05315&Version=kjv\">nephesh<\/a>. The meanings are similar: life. So again if we take the words grave and life together, we clearly see that the meaning of this verse is that Jesus would not remain in the grave, his life would not end there. &bull; Lastly, if a writer explicitly wanted to designate the place of the damned, he had another Greek word at his disposal, namely <a href=\"http:\/\/cf.blueletterbible.org\/lang\/lexicon\/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G1067&Version=kjv\">geenna<\/a>. See for example <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/mt\/5.html#v22\">Matthew 5:22<\/a> where this word is used. &bull; Looking around on the Internet I saw an enormous amount of confusion. It is unfortunate that in our days people are so arrogant that they disregard the wisdom and study of previous ages. Commentators are no longer consulted and people just start writing the most irresponsible nonsense. For this verse I have consulted an article written by Dr. Whitby that appeared as an appendix on a 1753 Dutch commentary. There does not seem to be an online commentary that comes even close, but I can recommend <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gotquestions.org\/did-Jesus-go-to-hell.html\">Did Jesus go to hell between His death and resurrection<\/a>. This articles also discusses a subject I didn't discuss, namely where did Jesus soul go. He was not only God, but man as well. And a man's soul is not omnipresent. Jesus soul wasn't in the grave and didn't die, but like the soul of the malefactor on the cross went to the abode of the death, paradise in their case, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/lk\/23.html#v43\">Luke 23:43<\/a>."},{"v":"205002032","c":"See <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/jn\/2.html#v19\">John 2:19<\/a>."},{"v":"205002038","c":"The intention of Peter here is not to give the baptismal formula as is clear from the occasion and audience he addresses. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freegrace.net\/gill\/Acts\/Acts_2.htm#38\">As John Gill says<\/a>: <blockquote>not to the exclusion of the Father, and of the Spirit, in whose name also this ordinance is to be administered, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/mt\/28.html#v19\">Matthew 28:19<\/a>, but the name of Jesus Christ is particularly mentioned, because of these Jews, who had before rejected and denied him as the Messiah; but now, upon their repentance and faith, they are to be baptized in his name, by his authority, according to his command; professing their faith in him, devoting themselves to him, and calling on his name.<\/blockquote>"},{"v":"205002044","c":"The author of the SAB interprets the phrase \u201chad all things in common\u201d as \u201cthe first Christians didn't have private property.\u201d But that is not the intended meaning as we see in the next verse.

Ananias wanted the honor of being known for having giving all the money he received for his land to the apostles. But without actually giving all the money. So together with his wife he came up with a plan to offer a part of the money to the apostles while claiming it was everything he had received for that piece of land. <a href=\"5.html#v8\">verse 8<\/a> clearly demonstrates that this is what he told the apostle Peter. But Peter doesn't say, <a href=\"5.html#v4\">verse 4<\/a>, that he had to give all the money. Peter tells Ananias the money was his own, again demonstrating this wasn't communism.

So this time we not only look at Jacob's children, but also at the wives of his sons. Again the math: <ol> <li>Of Jacob's sixty nine children still alive, three were already in Egypt: Joseph and his two sons. So that's sixty six children which are in Canaan, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/gen\/46.html#v26\">Gen. 46:26<\/a>.<\/li> <!-- <li>But two children were not yet born: Hezron and Hamul, the sons of --> <!-- Pharez.<\/li> --> <li>Add the number of wives of Jacob's children, which are eleven wives. That would give us a total of 77 souls called. But it might be that, like Jacob's wives, some of them had died as well. So two could have died as well.<\/li> <li>But there is another explanation that is more likely. It seems that the events mentioned in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/gen\/38.html\">Gen. 38<\/a> played itself out over a number of years. So when Judah traveled to Egypt, Perez and Zerah might have been just young children. So the two sons of Perez, Hezron and Hamul, would have been born in Egypt, and therefore cannot be included in the number of persons that Joseph called.<\/li> <li>All Jacob's wives had died by this time, so we don't have to include them.<\/li> <\/ol> And we arrive at a total of seventy five souls called by Joseph. &bull; As always I'm heavily indebted to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studylight.org\/com\/geb\/view.cgi?book=ac&chapter=7&verse=14\">John Gill<\/a>.

First of all, Jacob was buried in a cave in the field of Machpelah, about fifty kilometers from Sichem as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/gen\/50.html#v13\">Gen. 50:13<\/a> clearly states. But Stephen here does not just mention Jacob, he also mentions his twelve sons. Jacob's twelve sons were buried in Sichem\/Shechem as we can glimpse from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/jos\/24.html#v32\">Jos. 24:32<\/a>. So the phrase \u201cwere carried over into Sychem\u201d refers to the twelve patriarchs, the twelve sons of Jacob, not to Jacob. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apologeticspress.org\/articles\/142\">The original Greek language makes this very clear<\/a>.

But in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/gen\/33.html#v19\">Gen. 33:19<\/a> we read that Jacob bought a parcel of a field from the children of Hamor, the father of Shechem. The best explanation for this verse is that some words have been left out. In English we would have inserted the word sepulchre again. This is not rare the Bible, for example <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/ps\/133.html#v3\">Psalm 133:3<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/1jn\/2.html#v19\">1 John 2:19<\/a> (added words are in italics).

However, I was unable to unearth any article about snake fossils on Malta, nor any artifacts that would shed light on snakes that once might have lived on Malta. From Jackie from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.heritagemalta.org\/\">Heritage Malta<\/a> I received the following information: <blockquote>Four species of snakes are present (in the wild) in the Maltese Islands of which three are relatively recent additions. The only indigenous snake is the Western Whip Snake Coluber viridiflavus which is a non-poisonous species. The other three, namely Algerian Whipsnake Coluber algirus, Leopard Snake Elaphe situla and Cat Snake Telescopus fallax have been introduced by man. Of these only the latter has some form of poison. Although snakes appear in the archaeological context (eg. the stone slab in Mus of Archaeology of Gozo - from ggantija, which has a snake on its side) this does not imply that they were poisonous. On the other hand, poisonous species such as Natrix natrix which occurs in nearby Sicily may have been eradicated by man through time.<\/blockquote> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ionion.com\/english\/kefalonia\/culture\/monasteries\/enstpaul.htm\">Researcher Heinz Warnecke believes that Paul did not shipwreck on Malta, but near Celaphonia<\/a>, which has poisonous vipers."},{"v":"205028008","c":"Would they have come to Paul if he didn't heal them?

Paul continues with: \u201cthem that had not sinned <em>after the similitude of Adam\u2019s transgression<\/em>.\u201d But then, this is the author of the SAB's strongest point: misquoting the Bible. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.studylight.org\/com\/geb\/view.cgi?book=rom&chapter=5&verse=14\">What Paul says here is<\/a>: <blockquote>This does not exclude the dominion of death over such who had sinned after the likeness of Adam, but rather confirms its power over them; nor does it intend adult Gentiles, who did not sin in the same manner, nor against the same law, as Adam did; but it designs infants, not yet guilty of actual sin; and therefore since death reigns over them, who only holds and exercises his dominion by virtue of sin, it follows, that they must have original sin in them; the guilt of Adam's transgression must be imputed to them, and the corruption of nature, from him, derived unto them, or it could not reign over them.<\/blockquote> On who was to blame for original sin: Adam as this verse clearly says. He was the head of the covenant, our covenant father.

The phrase \u201cby one man's disobedience many were made sinners\u201d does not mean that innocent people are made sinners. To give the same example again: if a father had inherited a large fortune, and gambled it away, it simply means his children do not have access to that fortune, and have to live in poverty. The father was fully responsible here, was he not? He made his children poor by his actions. It was his responsibility. It is not unfair nor unjust that his children live in poverty now, else there would be no responsibility in this world. &bull; So it was by Adam: by his disobedience he brought sin into this world. His children have to live with the consequences. And we are not punished for Adam's sin, but for our own only. If we do not sin, but obey the law perfectly all our lives, we will enter heaven.

It is also clearly unnecessary that we have to understand exactly God's predestination. But the Bible tells us clearly what the predestination is not. As God will judge us, it indicates we have a free will. Else the judgment would be a mockery. But it is also clear that our free will is no longer free in the sense that we can choose good and evil. Our will is inclined towards evil. The condition of humanity is described in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/ezek\/37.html\">Ezek. 37<\/a> as a valley of dry bones: <blockquote> And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live?

That he can make a decision to follow God. That theology is utterly rejected by the apostle Paul as the author of the SAB senses. We have no more ability to choose for God as we can choose not to sleep. Our will is fallen as well, and inclined to all kinds of evil. If God didn't call us, and didn't give us a new heart, we would and could never be saved.

This question came up frequently in the transitional period between the Old Testament and New Testament. But the answers the apostles gave at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/acts\/15.html#v6\">the Apostle Convent<\/a> (Acts 15:6-31) was clear: <blockquote> For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well. <\/blockquote> So it is not necessary to keep <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/subjects\/old_testament_laws.html\">the Old Testament Laws<\/a> as far as they were intended for a particular region or for a particular time and as far as they were clearly abolished by the lawgiver. &bull; Coming back to the question of keeping the Sabbath, yes, we still must do that. It is part of the moral law, which was not abolished at all. And God himself rested on the Sabbath before the Fall, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/gen\/2.html#v2\">Gen. 2:2<\/a>. So the question the apostle Paul addresses here is not if we should keep the Sabbath, but if the church in Rome should keep both the Sabbath and the Saturday as well. The New Testament makes it abundantly clear that the Saturday is abolished (such as this verse). In the Old Testament the rest was at the end of the week, as it was the end of creation and it was a sign of the promise of rest after works. In the New Testament we rest at beginning of the week to remember that the Lord Jesus Christ rose from the dead and that this is the beginning of the recreation. It is the day that Christ showed himself to his Church. That Sunday observance was the practice of the early Church is abundantly clear from verses like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/acts\/20.html#v7\">Acts 20:7<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/1cor\/16.html#v1\">1 Cor. 16:1-2<\/a>. &bull; So to answer the question: yes, we should remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. &bull; For a more in-depth treatment, see \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fpchurch.org.uk\/Beliefs\/One_Day_in_Seven.php\">One Day in Seven<\/a>\u201d."},{"v":"206014010","c":"Shall a society have no judges?

The bishops (elders) teach, the deacons care for the poor. &bull; The second thing is the Greek. The Greek work used here is <a href=\"http:\/\/cf.blueletterbible.org\/lang\/lexicon\/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G1249&t=kjv\">diakonos<\/a>.

So the translation in the RSV is possible. &bull; But the question can be asked: is that translation the only one? The word diakonos occurs many times in the Bible and is usually translated with servant. For example in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/mt\/22.html#v13\">Matthew 22:13<\/a> the word diakonos is used, where our English reads servants. The word deacon is clearly an incorrect translation for that verse. So it should be the context that determines if deacon or servant is the best translation. &bull; Which brings us tot the third point: is the word deacon the best translation here? Does this verse mention bishops in the same breath? Does the context say she was an office bearer? The answer to these questions is no. If we use the word deacon and take into account the next verse, we read: \u201c...Phebe, a deacon, ... receive her ... as becometh saints.\u201d This makes it clear she is one of the saints. Given the formula in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/phil\/1.html#v1\">Phil. 1:1<\/a> the word deacon is not the most appropriate. Because the text at that location clearly distinguishes between deacon and servant: \u201cto all the saints ... with the bishops and deacons.\u201d &bull; According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/phil\/1.html#v1\">Phil. 1:1<\/a> saints, deacons and bishops are three distinct groups.

That's a completely different form of obedience and it does not replace the obedience to God unless they ask us to do something that is contrary to the Word of God. This is even clear from the same verse!

For example <a href=\"http:\/\/www.religioustolerance.org\/chr_ntb3.htm\">another source<\/a> says that most liberal scholars believe that Colossians may have been written by Paul. &bull; But let's look at some facts: the first verse claims it is written by Paul. The epistle <a href=\"4.html#v18\">ends with Paul's own signature<\/a> (Col. 4:18). Obviously we don't have the autographs anymore, but the first Church did have the autographs for ages, so it could easily verify Paul's signature, see my comment on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/eph\/1.html#v1\">Ephesians 1:1<\/a>. And it is not that there were no attempt at forgeries even in Paul's time. Paul was aware of them, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/2th\/2.html#v2\">2 Thess. 2:2<\/a> and that's why he signed everyone of his own letters with his own hand. &bull; I suppose our modern scholars will argue that our counterfeiter forged all these things, even adding greetings to particular persons, see <a href=\"4.html#v10\">chapter 4:10-15<\/a>. I suppose there are no limits we may attribute to our all powerful forger. Just as most of Shakespeare's work was not written by Shakespeare but by someone who wrote in his style. Something like that. But such arguing is ridiculous. There is nothing known about this mystical forger of Paul's work, no name, no place, no historical accusations, nothing. This epistle was accepted as genuine by the church because it was brought by Tychicus and Onesimus, straight from Paul, had Paul's signature, and the autograph was kept. &bull; To assume this epistle was forged is to assume that this verse is false: it is not Paul. So if this is true, what about <a href=\"1.html#v5\">verse 5<\/a>? We read: \u201cFor the hope which is laid up for you in heaven\u201d. If verse 1 is false, what reason do we have to believe verse 5 is true?

Not something of: well you ate, but I didn't mean it. God meant it. Man would die. And man did die. His body died as it now became a vehicle for sin, and became capable of bodily death. His soul died as it was now inclined to all kinds of evil and would be cast in hell soon to die forever. How could this state of affairs be remedied? That is what Jesus Christ did: he became man, a descendant of Eve, but not of Adam, he remained perfectly obedient and bore the curse for mankind. That curse was death, the shedding of blood. And because he was God, he was capable of an infinitely worthy sacrifice. By his obedience he bought his people with a price, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/1cor\/6.html#v20\">1 Cor. 6:20<\/a>, namely his blood, as he was obedient till the end."},{"v":"212001015","c":"Yes, God is a spirit and therefore invisible.

Either the guinea worm was created by God and had a different and useful life cycle, but after the fall it deteriorated into this behaviour.

In that condition he meets Paul again. Paul, who used to be a free man, but now in bonds. Onesimus was now receptive for the gospel, and became a Christian.

Each scene takes a different point of view, as just one scene wouldn't suffice. Each scene is itself broken up in seven parts (seven churches, seven trumpets, etc.). For example the first scene, starting in <a href=\"2.html#v1\">chapter 2:1<\/a>, shows the history of the church, with its low and high points. Gradually more and more the true powers of history are revealed, and we see that history is actually a spiritual battle, with Christ and his Church on one hand, and Satan and his followers on the other. So Revelations is divided into seven scenes, and in my comments I will point out where a new scene starts."},{"v":"227001006","c":"Not literally, but figuratively: by taking the punishment we deserved, death, he cleansed us from the filth and death in which we had immersed ourselves and from which we would not be rescued, nor could do so by our own endeavours."},{"v":"227001007","c":"I see no objection to taking the phrase \u201cevery eye shall see him\u201d as simply meaning the eyes of every man living at that time.

It's not about the world and its leaders, it's not about the last seven years of the world, this book covers the history of the church."},{"v":"227002001","c":"This is the first of the seven scenes, each one describing the history of the world from John to the end of times. The first scene describes the history of the visible church over the ages. The descriptions of the churches are to be applied concurrently: in each age some congregations are more spiritual than others, but also successively: if a congregation was spiritual in the past, it does not mean it will remain that, but this can change over time. &bull; On who John was writing to: why would John have to write a book to unseen spiritual beings? They have no need of Scripture. Seven times we have the phrase \u201cUnto the angel of the church of\u201c in this and subsequent sections. The explanation of the word angel is given in <a href=\"1.html#v20\">the previous verse<\/a> (Rev. 1:20): \u201cThe seven stars are the angels of the seven churches.\u201d We find these seven stars <a href=\"1.html#v16\">first in the right hand<\/a> (Rev. 1:16) of Christ. Together these verses give us the meaning: the word angel should be read in its original meaning, namely <em>messenger<\/em>: Christ employs these messengers to rule his church. The word angel does not mean any particular office or person or hierarchy. But it simply means all who rule in the church, and that they only derive their authority from Christ. Their job description is being a messenger: what Christ tells them, they must tell their congregation. Not more. Not less."},{"v":"227002009","c":"Note that Jesus was a Jew, all the apostles were Jews, etc. etc. So it is clearly untrue only those who rejected Christ were the true Jews as the author of the SAB has it. But I think we should take the word Jew here in a wider, more symbolic meaning. As the apostle Paul explains, the true children of Abraham are the children after Abraham's faith, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/rom\/9.html#v8\">Rom. 9:8<\/a>. And in the history of the Church we have often seen some claiming themselves to be the true church, but by their works they demonstrated they were not."},{"v":"227002013","c":"The I is indeed Jesus here, as he is speaking this message, and John is writing it down.

But Jesus does not say he will fight against his church, but he will fight those holding the doctrine of Balaam."},{"v":"227002018","c":"This is a clear reference to the man described in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.berenddeboer.net\/sab\/dan\/10.html#v6\">Daniel 10:6<\/a>. As this is a book of symbols, we probably should understand this symbolically. That Christ's eyes are as fire means he does not need light to see: light comes forth of himself, he is completely self-sufficient, and able to see in the darkest corner's of the human heart. That his feet are as brass indicate his strength and might to overcome any who think they can resist."},{"v":"227002020","c":"Jezebel here is clearly the name of all of them who teach the things described in this verse: they can be part of the world, and do the things of the world, and still be part of the body of Christ.

But the author didn't think that verse man-unfriendly."},{"v":"227002022","c":"Why would this verse by women-unfriendly? Everyone who listens to her, will be cast down with her. That includes the males."},{"v":"227002023","c":"The author of the SAB finds it unjust that the head of the Church, Jesus Christ, has some input in his own church.
